DUP project.
This is a private project for dup.

I clearly mention that I copied mmdetection, yolov7 and yolov9 official repository in the link below.

https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection



For annotation, I used 2 base repositoreis below (LabelImg and Yolo-annotation-Tool-New).

Based on the projects above, I modify the codes as my preference.

All dataset are not included in the repository even though it is private repository for 2 reasons - size and privacy.
If you are interested in the project and the dataset, contact us throughout the paper below. We can find the way to use the dataset officially with Seoul Metro as we did.

"** below. To be updated **."

The results from the mmdetection is converted to yolo format which is txt file per image throughout result_to_yolo.py file.
