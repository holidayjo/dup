DUP project.
This is a private project for dup.

I clearly mention that I copied yolov7 official repository in the link below.

https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.

For annotation, I used 2 base repositoreis below (LabelImg and Yolo-annotation-Tool-New).

https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg

https://github.com/ManivannanMurugavel/Yolo-Annotation-Tool-New-

Based on the projects above, I modify the codes as my preference.

All dataset are not included in the repository even though it is private repository for 2 reasons - size and privacy.

The results from the mmdetection is converted to yolo format which is txt file per image throughout result_to_yolo.py file.
